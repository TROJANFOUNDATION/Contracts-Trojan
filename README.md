Money has to undergo a metamorphosis again, it has to relinquish its role in the market economy and engage in an economy of capacities. Then we would come full circle, since each human being can then act within his company as co-creator of the future, can - in full dignity - contribute to shaping this future.

They must also think about economic structures. They must always think through the entire social organism.

It carves out spaces where can experience the transformation of what we can be to each other, and do for each other. It generates value that circulates within and between communities, and it refuses the dictated roles of the imposed order of dept-value.
